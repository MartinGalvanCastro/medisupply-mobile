/**
 * Response model for Ably token request.

This response contains a token request object that can be used by the client
to authenticate with Ably's real-time service. The token request is generated
server-side with appropriate capabilities and permissions.

Attributes:
    token_request: Dictionary containing the Ably token request object that
        includes keyName, ttl, timestamp, capability, nonce, and mac (HMAC signature)
    expires_at: Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the token expires
    channels: List of channel names the token has access to

Example:
    ```python
    {
        "token_request": {
            "keyName": "key_id",
            "ttl": 3600000,
            "timestamp": 1640000000000,
            "capability": '{"dev:users:user123":["subscribe"]}',
            "nonce": "random_nonce",
            "mac": "base64_encoded_signature"
        },
        "expires_at": 1640003600000,
        "channels": ["dev:users:user123"]
    }
    ```
